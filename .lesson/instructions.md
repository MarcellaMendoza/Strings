# Instructions  

1. Grab the welcome-element paragraph and store it in a variable called welcomeElement.

2. Create two variables (name & greeting) that contains your name and the greeting we want to render on the page.

3. Render the welcome message using welcomeElement.innerText.

BONUS PROBLEM:
Add this emoji to the end of the greeting: üê≤
The trick: you must do this with a new line of code and use the count = count + 1 technique. Don't just simply add the emoji as a string to the greeting variable! Try a different way!
